            <p className='modal__text'>The Hospital District is running a new campaign focusing on the youth that starts this week. The J.O.B.S program, or the Junior Orator for Biblical Studies, is designed to set young people on the path of freedom and liberty by the hands of the Hospital District. All youth that qualify will be automatically enrolled and contacted by officials in the coming months.</p>
            <p className='modal__text'>Directors of the new program highlight itâ€™s potential in keeping young people off the streets and away from the Sick District. J.O.B.S will receive ample support for their work in the Hospital including free accommodation and a $75/week stipend.</p>
            <p className='modal__text'>The passing of the J.O.B.S program was unanimous and celebrated by everyone in the Hospital District. The youth have been a large topic of debate for many in the Hospital District as many youths spend their time in the Bunker and Sick District. It is believed that this program will right this unbalance while providing an opportunity for young people and helping those who need it the most.</p>
